<h3>PALINDROME VERSES.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">B&oelig;oticus</span> inquires (Vol. vi., p 209.)
  whence comes the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In p.&nbsp;352. of the same volume W. W. T. (quoting from D'Israeli's
  <i>Curiosities of Literature</i> a passage which supplies the hexameter
  completing the distich, and attributes the verses to Sidonius
  Apollinaris) asks where may be found a legend which represents the two
  lines to have formed part of a dialogue between the fiend, under the form
  of a mule, and a monk, who was his rider. B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C., at p.&nbsp;521. of the
  same volume, sends a passage from the <i>Dictionnaire Littéraire</i>,
  giving the complete distich:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Signa te, signa, temere me tangis et angis.</p>
      <p>Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and attributing it to the devil, but without supplying any more
  authentic parentage for the lines. The following Note will contribute a
  fact or two to the investigation of the subject; but I shall be obliged
  to conclude by reiterating the original Query of <span
  class="sc">B&oelig;oticus</span>, Who was the real author of the
  lines?</p>

  <p>In a little work entitled <i>A Summer in Brittany</i>, published by me
  in 1840, may be found (at p.&nbsp;99. of vol. i.) a legend, which relates how
  one Jean Patye, canon of Cambremer, in the chapter of Bayeux, rode the
  devil to Rome, for the purpose of there chanting the epistle at the
  midnight mass at Christmas, according to the tenor of an ancient bond,
  which obliged the chapter to send one of their number yearly to Rome for
  that purpose. This story I met with in a little volume, entitled
  <i>Contes populaires, Préjugés, Patois, Proverbes de l'Arrondissement de
  Bayeux, recueillis et publiés</i>, par F. Pluquet, the frontispiece of
  which consists of a sufficiently graphic representation of the worthy
  canon's feat. Pluquet concludes his narrative by stating that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Etienne Tabourot dans ses <i>Bigarrures</i>, publiées sous le nom du
  <i>Seigneur des Accords</i>, rapporte que c'est à Saint Antide que le
  diable, qui le portait à Rome sur son dos, adresse le distique latin dont
  il est question ci-dessus."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It should seem that this trick of <i>carrying people to Rome</i> was
  attributed to the devil, by those conversant with his habits, in other
  centuries besides the nineteenth.</p>

  <p>I have not here the means of looking at the work to which Pluquet
  refers; but if any of your correspondents, who live in more bookish lands
  than this, will do so, they may perchance obtain some clue to the
  original authorship of the lines; for in Sidonius Apollinaris I cannot
  find them. The only edition of his works to which I have the means of
  referring is the quarto of Adrien Perrier, Paris, 1609. Among the verses
  contained in that volume, I think I can assert that the lines in question
  are not. We all know that the worthy author of the <i>Curiosities of
  Literature</i> cannot be much depended upon for accuracy.</p>

  <p>Once again, then, Who was the author of this specimen, perhaps the
  most perfect extant, of palindromic absurdity?</p>

  <p class="author">T. A. T.</p>

  <p class="address">Florence.</p>

<h3>UNPUBLISHED LETTER OF LORD NELSON.</h3>

  <p>The following letter of Lord Nelson may, especially at the present
  moment, interest and amuse some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." The
  original is in my possession, and was given me by the late Miss Churchey
  of Brecon, daughter of the gentleman to whom it was addressed. Can any of
  your readers inform me where the "old lines" quoted by the great hero are

  <p>Sir,</p>

  <p>Your idea is most just and proper, that a provision should be made for
  midshipmen who have served a certain time with good characters, and
  certainly twenty pounds is a very small allowance; but how will your
  surprise be increased, when I tell you that their <i>full</i> pay, when
  watching, fighting and bleeding for their country at sea, is not equal to
  that sum. An admiral's half-pay is scarcely equal, including the run of a
  kitchen, to that of a French cook; a captain's but little better than a
  valet's; and a lieutenant's certainly not equal to a London footman's; a
  midshipman's nothing. But as I am a seaman, and faring with them, I can
  say nothing. I will only apply some very old lines wrote at the end of
  some former war:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Our God and sailor we adore,</p>
      <p class="i1">In time of danger, not before;</p>
      <p>The danger past, both are alike requited,</p>
      <p>God is forgotten, and the sailor slighted."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Your feelings do you great honour, and I only wish all others in the
  kingdom were the same. However, if ever I should be placed in a situation
  to be useful to such a deserving set of young men as our mids, nothing
  shall be left undone which may be in the power of,</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Devonshire Superstitions.</i>&mdash;Seeing that you sometimes
  insert extracts from newspapers, I forward you a copy of a paragraph
  which appeared in <i>The Times</i> of March 7, 1854, and which is worth a
  corner in your folk-lore columns:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The following gross case of superstition, which occurred as late as
  Sunday se'nnight, in one of the largest <!-- Page 345 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>{345}</span>market towns in the
  north of Devon, is related by an eye-witness:&mdash;A young woman, living
  in the neighbourhood of Holsworthy, having for some time past been
  subject to periodical fits of illness, endeavoured to effect a cure by
  attendance at the afternoon service at the parish church, accompanied by
  thirty young men, her near neighbours. Service over, she sat in the porch
  of the church, and each of the young men, as they passed out in
  succession, dropped a penny into her lap; but the last, instead of a
  penny, gave her half-a-crown, taking from her the twenty-nine pennies
  which she had already received. With this half-crown in her hand, she
  walked three times round the communion-table, and afterwards had it made
  into a ring, by the wearing of which she believes she will recover her
  health."</p>

  <p><i>Quacks.</i>&mdash;In the neighbourhood of Sevenoaks, Kent, a little
  girl was bitten by a mad dog lately. Instead of sending for the doctor,
  her father posted off to an old woman famous for her treatment of
  hydrophobia. The old woman sent a quart bottle of some dark liquid, which
  the patient is to take twice or thrice daily: and for this the father,
  though but a poor labourer, had to pay one pound. The liquid is said by
  the "country sort" to be infallible. It is made of herbs plucked by the
  old woman, and mixed with milk. Its preparation is of course a grand
  secret. As yet, the child keeps well.</p>

  <p>Near Whitechapel, London, is another old woman, equally famous; but
  her peculiar talent is not for hydrophobia, but for scalds. Whenever any
  of the Germans employed in the numerous sugar-refineries in that
  neighbourhood scald themselves, they beg, instead of being sent to the
  hospital, to be taken to the old woman. For a few sovereigns, she will
  take them in, nurse, and cure them; and I was informed by a proprietor of
  a large sugar-house there, that often in a week she will heal a scald as
  thoroughly as the hospital will in a month, and send the men back hearty
  and fit for work to boot. She uses a good deal of linseed-oil, I am told;
  but her great secret, they say, is, that she gives the whole of her time
  and attention to the patient.</p>

  <p><i>Vallancey's Green Book.</i>&mdash;Perhaps your readers are not
  aware of the existence of the curious and interesting volume mentioned in
  the following cutting from Jones's last <i>Catalogue</i> (D'Olier St.
  Dublin). It may therefore be worth making a note of in your columns:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"1008. Vallancey's Green Book, <i>manuscript, folio</i>.</p>

  <p>*** Vallancey's Green Book, so named from being bound in green vellum,
  was the volume in which the celebrated Irish antiquary, General Charles
  Vallancey, entered the titles of all the manuscripts and printed works
  relative to Ireland which he had occasion to consult in his antiquarian
  researches. The copy now offered for sale is believed to be the only one
  extant. Bound in the same volume is a collection of the titles of all the
  manuscripts relating to Ireland, which are preserved in the Archbishop of
  Canterbury's library, at Lambeth, London."</p>

  <p><i>Herrings.</i>&mdash;"The lovers of fish" may be glad to learn what
  a bloater is, a mystery which I endeavoured to unravel when lately on the
  Norfolk coast. A bloater, I was informed, is a large, plump herring (as
  we say a <i>bloated</i> toad); and the genuine claimants of the title
  fall by their own weight from the meshes of the net.</p>

  <p>The origin of the simile&mdash;"As dead as a herring"&mdash;may not be
  generally known. This fish dies immediately upon its removal from the
  native element (strange to say) from want of air; for swimming near the
  surface it requires much, and the gills, when dry, cannot perform their
  function.</p>

  would earnestly urge the formation of such a list as the one I now <!--

<h3>PRINTS OF LONDON BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE.</h3>

  <p>In addition to the Tower, there was in Cromwell's time the
  fortification of Baynard's Castle, near Blackfriars, and the city gates
  were also fortifications on a small scale; they were rebuilt (St. John's,
  Clerkenwell, excepted, which was spared) after the Great Fire, and were
  taken down somewhere about 1760. Can any of your readers tell me whether
  there is any series of prints extant of the most remarkable buildings
  which were destroyed by the fire? There are some few maps, and a print or
  two interspersed here and there, in the British Museum; but is there any
  regular series of plates? We know that Inigo Jones built a Grecian
  portico on to the east end of the Gothic cathedral of old St. Paul's,
  surmounted with statues of Charles I., &amp;c.; that the Puritans
  destroyed a beautiful conduit at the top of Cheapside; that Sir Thomas
  Gresham's Exchange was standing. But among the many city halls burnt
  down, were there any fine specimens of architecture, any churches worthy
  of note? And as Guildhall was not entirely consumed, what parts of the
  present edifice belong to the olden time?</p>

  <p>You are doubtless aware that the fire did not extend to St. Giles's
  Cripplegate, and that at the back of the church are remains of the old
  city walls.</p>

<h3>BATTLE OF OTTERBURN.</h3>

  <p>On what authority does Mr. Tytler (<i>History of Scotland</i>, vol.
  iii. pp. 45&mdash;53.), in his otherwise very fair account of this
  celebrated battle, assert that the Earl of Douglas was a younger man than
  Hotspur? I have no doubt that he found it so recorded somewhere, and
  willingly believed that his countrymen had prevailed, not only over
  superior numbers of the enemy, but also over greater experience on the
  part of the hostile general; but a little more investigation would have
  shown him that the difference of age lay the other way. Henry Percy, by
  his own account (in the Scrope and Grosvenor Controversy), was born in
  1366, and was therefore twenty-two when the battle was fought. I do not
  know that there is any direct evidence to Douglas's age, but the
  following considerations appear to me decisive as to his being much older
  than his rival.</p>

  <p>1. Froissart's visit to Scotland was undoubtedly prior to 1366
  (although the exact date is not given), and during his stay of fifteen
  days at Dalkeith, he saw much of the youthful heir of that castle, the
  future hero of Otterburn, and describes him as a "promising youth."</p>

  <p>2. Hotspur, in his deposition above mentioned, says that he first bore
  arms at the siege of Berwick in 1378; but his antagonist must have
  commenced his military career long before, as Froissart mentions him as
  knighted on the occasion of the battle fought a few days after the
  surrender of that place, between Sir Archibald Douglas and Sir Thomas
  Musgrave; none but kings' sons were knighted in childhood in those days,
  or without undergoing a long previous probation in the inferior grades of
  chivalry.</p>

  <p>3. An early and constant family (if not general) tradition asserts
  that Douglas had a natural son <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>{349}</span>(ancestor of the Cavers family), old
  enough to bear his father's banner in the battle; on this, however, I lay
  little stress, as Froissart distinctly assigns that honourable post to
  another person, David Campbell, who was slain by the side of his
  lord.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tytler is also evidently wrong in placing, on the authority of
  Macpherson's <i>Notes on Winton</i>, this battle on the 5th of August,
  1388. Froissart gives the date as the 19th of August, and as the moon was
  full on the 18th, the combatants would have bright moonlight all night,
  which agrees with all the narratives; on the 5th they would have little
  moonlight, and would have lost it soon.</p>

  <p>Though not very germane to the matter, except as being a point of
  chronology, I may add here that the remarkable solar eclipse, long
  remembered in Scotland by the name of the "Dark Hour," did not occur, as
  stated by Mr. Tytler, on 17th June, 1432, but on the same month and day
  of the following year.</p>

<h3>DE BEAUVOIR PEDIGREE.</h3>

  <p>I have in my possession a curious ancient pedigree of De Beauvoir and
  Harryes, headed thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The name De Beauvoir is from &mdash;&mdash; in the kingdom of
  England; came into England with y<sup>e</sup> Conquest of the Norman
  Duke, from whom is descended all that are now in England, they bearing
  for their coate armour the <i>first</i>, Azure, a chevron or, between
  three cinquefeuilles argent, by the name of De Beauvoir. The
  <i>second</i> he beareth the guelles a chevron between three hayeres
  heads erased, by the name of Harreys. The <i>third</i> (or) a lyon
  rampant azure, by the name of Throlpe. The <i>fourth</i>, Argent, a fess
  between three cressentes azure, by the name of ... within a mantle
  doubled guelles on two helmetes and torseyes proper and the first a
  demy-dragon, adorned properly guelles and argent, vert, by the foresaid
  name De Beauvoir; on the second a harye sitting argent between two bushes
  vert."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The pedigree begins with "Sir Robert Beauvoir, Lord Beauvoir, Lord
  Baron of Beaver Castle, Knt.;" and the maternal line with "Sir Robert
  Harryes of Malden in Essex, Knt., came into England with the Saxons."</p>

  <p>In the tenth descent the sole heiress is represented as marrying
  "Robert, Lord Bellmoint," whose sole daughter married "John, Lord
  Manners, father of Edmund Manners, first Earl of Rutland, from whom is
  descended Roger, Earl of Rutland, now living."</p>

  <p>The pedigree ends with the nineteenth descendant, Henry de Beauvoir,
  of the Isle of Guernsey, who married the daughter of Peter Harreys of the
  Isle of Guernsey.</p>

  <p>Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." inform me whether descendants of that
  marriage are still to be found, and where?</p>

  <p>There are points in the pedigree, as genealogists will see, totally
  discrepant from the Peerages.</p>

<h3>Minor Queries.</h3>

  <p><i>Dog-whippers: Frankincense.</i>&mdash;Can any reader throw light
  upon the following entries in the churchwardens' account-book for the
  parish of Forest Hill, near Oxford?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1694. P<sup>d</sup> to Tho. Mills for whipping dogs out of church, 1
  shilling.</p>

  <p>"1702. P<sup>d</sup> for frankincense for the church, 6 pence."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The only passage which occurs to me as at all bearing upon so late a
  use of incense in parish churches in this country, is the following
  extract from Herbert:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The country parson hath a care that his church be swept and kept
  clean; and at great festivals, strewed and stuck with boughs, and
  perfumed with incense."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This hardly brings the custom later than 1630.</p>

  <p>As regards the former entry, I am told by a friend that the office of
  dog-whipper existed about fifty years ago for the church of Heversham in
  Westmoreland.</p>

  <p><i>Atchievement in Yorkshire&mdash;Lipyeatt Family.</i>&mdash;Found
  and noted in a Yorkshire church tower, an atchievement painted apparently
  about forty or fifty years ago, of which no account can be given by the

  Impaling: Vert, three swans in tri, statant, wings erect, argent. Crest,
  a lion passant azure, langued gules. The swans have head, neck, and body
  like swans, but their legs appear to have been borrowed from the stork.
  It is suspected that the dexter coat belongs to one of the Wiltshire
  Lipyeatts.</p>

  domestic habits, active and careful in the management of her family
  affairs." This is so directly opposed, not only to Scott's description,
  but to the generality of traditions about her, that, as Campbell says,
  "it makes the hair of one's literary faith stand on end." Helen was, very
  likely, a different person from what she afterwards became, ere the
  events happened that drove Rob Roy "to the hill-side to become a broken
  man;" but one can hardly imagine her, in her most happy days, to have
  been such a person as is above depicted&mdash;an amiable wife and clever

  Cambridge, first chaplain to Bancroft and James I., whether he or Thos.
  King, 1605, or James King, 1609? One of them began his sermon at St.
  James: "I, King of Kings, come to James the First and Sixth, nothing
  wavering."</p>

  <p>"These puns much applauded in those times, insomuch that the preacher
  would stop to receive applause, which was expressed by loud and repeated

  <p><i>Scroope Family.</i>&mdash;Will any one be so good as to clear up
  the doubts noticed in the peerage books as to the family of Henry Lord
  Scroope, of Bolton, who died about 22 Henry VII.? His wives are generally
  stated to have been daughters of the Earl of Northumberland and Lord
  Scroope of Upsal; but other accounts are to be met with. What however I
  particularly refer to, is the question, who was the mother of his
  daughter Alice, who married Sir Gilbert Talbot? Lady Talbot could not
  have been by the daughter of Lord Scroope of Upsal; as, if so, she and
  her issue would have inherited her grandfather's barony, which it is
  certain was enjoyed by his younger brothers. Very likely Mr. Scroope's
  unpublished volume on the Lords Scroope and their seat Coombe Castle
  explains this.</p>

  <p><i>Harrison the Regicide&mdash;Lowle.</i>&mdash;Thomas Willing, son of
  Joseph Willing and Anne Lowle (his second wife), married July 16, 1704,
  Anne Harrison, a grand-daughter of the Regicide. Charles (son of Thomas
  and Anne, born in Bristol, 1710) married Anne Shippen. One of their
  daughters married Sir Walter Stirling; and a <!-- Page 351 --><span

  (Miss Bingham) married Mr. Baring, afterwards Lord Ashburton. I should be
  obliged for information as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Through what descent was Anne Harrison a descendant of the
  Regicide?</p>

  <p>2. Is anything known of the Lowle family? Their arms were, "Sa., a

  <p><i>"Chair" or "Char."</i>&mdash;I am desirous of ascertaining the
  meaning of this term, as occurring frequently in the Cambridgeshire Fens.
  It is variously spelt, <i>chair</i>, <i>chaire</i>, <i>chare</i>, or
  <i>char</i>. In the Cambridgeshire dialect it may be remarked, <i>air</i>
  or <i>are</i> is pronounced as "ar." Thus, <i>upstairs</i>, <i>bare</i>,
  are "upstars," "bar." There is a Char Fen at Stretham, laid down in Sir
  Jonah Moore's Map (1663). There is also a Chare Fen at Cottenham; and at
  Littleport is a place called Littleport Chair. This last had the name at
  least as early as Edward II.'s reign; as in a description of a
  neighbouring fen, not later than that date, one boundary is "A le
  <i>chaire</i> per Himmingslode usque Gualslode End." A friend who has
  searched the documents in the Fen Office at Ely on this subject for me,
  has been unable to discover the least clue to the meaning of the
  term.</p>

  <p>At Newcastle-on-Tyne, a narrow street or passage between houses is
  called a <i>chare</i>; but there is nothing narrow about Char Fen, which
  was part of an open common. The course of the rivers at Littleport may be
  imagined to form a rude outline of a chair or seat; but this does not
  apply to the other instances in which the name occurs.</p>

  <p>There are numerous local names in the fens, of which the history may
  be traced for some centuries, deserving investigation.</p>

  <p><i>Aches.</i>&mdash;I am aware that there is abundant proof of "aches"

  fixes the pronunciation as <i>artches</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Leeming Hall.</i>&mdash;There was formerly a mansion somewhere

  the name of the present owner? I should also be glad to have some
  information respecting the genealogy of the family of Leemings, who
  formerly lived there, or to learn the name and residence of some member

  <p><i>Caricature; a Canterbury Tale.</i>&mdash;Many facts are recorded in

  and a third figure (?), are in a boat pushing off from shore, with Burke
  looking over a wall with a large bag in his hand. He says,
  "D&mdash;&mdash;me, Charley, don't leave me in the lurch;" who replies,
  "Self-preservation is the first law of nature." His companions joining
  with "Push off, Charley, push off."</p>

  <p><i>Perpetual Curates not represented in Convocation.</i>&mdash;In

  <p>"Under the old regime rectors and vicars were alone, generally

</blockquote>

  <p>I believe that this is correct, and that the curates spoken of as
  having their votes rejected in Day <i>versus</i> Knewstubbs, were
  perpetual curates: but can some of your correspondents confirm this view
  by facts?</p>

  <p><i>Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound."</i>&mdash;Can any of your

  the meaning of the following passage, which occurs in Act II. Sc. 4. of
  this extraordinary poem? It sounds so sweetly that one cannot but wish it
  were possible to understand it.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Asia.</i> Who made that sense which, when the winds of spring</p>
      <p>In rarest visitation, or the voice</p>
      <p>Of one beloved heard in youth alone,</p>
      <p>Fills the faint eyes with falling tears which dim</p>
      <p>The radiant looks of unbewailing flowers,</p>
      <p>And leaves this peopled world a solitude</p>
      <p>When it returns no more?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Shelley's mysticism is very often such as to render him unintelligible
  to ordinary readers, but it is combined here with a want of grammatical
  <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>{352}</span>connexion that makes obscurity ten times
  more obscure. I have not the least idea whether "fills" refers to "sense
  which," or to "voice;" but whichsoever it may belong to, it is evident
  that the other nominative singular, as also the plural "winds of spring,"
  have no verbs, either expressed or understood, to govern. A line or two
  may have dropped out; but all editions as far as I am aware, give the
  passage as above. In Act I., at p.&nbsp;195. line 7 of the edition of 1853,
  occurs a curious error (I presume of the press); Mercury, addressing the
  Furies, says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3hg3">"Back to your towers of iron,</p>
      <p>And gnash beside the streams of fire, and wail</p>
      <p>Your foodless teeth."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The having no food to put between one's teeth is no doubt a very
  sufficient cause for wailing, but still I think the passage would run
  better if "gnash" and "wail" exchanged places. How do other editions give
  it?</p>

  arms of Great Britain, without the harp, but with the Scots lion. You

  lion having been added at the same time by James I. The leopards occupy
  the first quarter, the ground of which is seméed with <i>hearts</i>; the
  Scots lion the second, his feet resting upon a quaint band, which seems
  to occupy the place of the usual bordure. The three fleurs-de-lis, very
  much broadened, and taking almost the shape of crowns, occupy the places
  of the third and fourth quarters.</p>

<h3>LEICESTER AS RANGER OF SNOWDON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;125.)</p>

  <p>In a note to Parry's <i>Royal Visits and Progresses in Wales</i>,
  p.&nbsp;317., I find the following allusion to the circumstances mentioned in
  <span class="sc">Elffin ap Gwyddno's</span> Query regarding Leicester's
  Rangership of Snowdon, and the patriotic opposition offered to his
  oppressions. I regret I am unable to afford the desired information
  respecting the imprisonment of the Welsh gentleman in the Tower. Could
  not this be furnished by some of your readers who have access to public
  documents and records of the period? This imprisonment is not mentioned
  either in the account I append, or in a longer one to be found in
  Appendix XVI. vol. iii. of Pennant's <i>Tour in Wales</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Among the Welsh nobility who formed a part of her Majesty's
  household, were Sir Richard Bulkeley, Bart., and Mrs. Blanche Parry, both
  of whom seem to have been brought up in the court from their infancy,
  and, consequently, in great esteem with her Majesty; so much so, that the
  Earl of Leicester, the Queen's favourite, began to be jealous of Sir
  Richard: and with a view of having him removed from court, he made an
  attempt to have him accused, upon false evidence, of treason. With this
  wicked design, the Earl of Leicester informed her Majesty that the
  council had been examining Sir Richard Bulkeley, and that they found him
  a dangerous person; that he dwelt in a suspicious corner of the world,
  and should be committed to the Tower. 'What! Sir Richard Bulkeley!' said
  the Queen; 'he never intended us any harm. We have brought him up from a
  boy, and have had special trial of his fidelity; ye shall not commit
  him.' 'We have the care of your Majesty's person,' said the Earl, 'and
  see more and hear more of the man than you do: he is of an aspiring mind,
  and lives in a remote place.' 'Before God!' replied the Queen; 'we will
  be sworn upon the Holy Evangelists, he never intended any harm.' And then
  her Majesty ran to the Bible, and kissing it, said: 'You shall not commit
  him; we have brought him up from a boy.' Sir Richard, however, was too
  high-minded to suffer such an imputation to be laid to his character. He
  insisted on an inquiry; during which it appeared, that Lord Dudley, Earl
  of Leicester, had been appointed a ranger of the Royal Forest of Snowdon,
  which, in the Queen's time, included some portion of Merioneth and
  Anglesey. This nobleman's insolence to the inhabitants of the forest was
  more than could be brooked. He tried to bring many freeholders' estates
  within the boundary; juries were empannelled, but the commissioners
  rejected their returns as unfavourable to the Earl. Those honest jurors,
  however, persisted, and found a verdict for the country. But in the year
  1538, he succeeded by a packed jury, who appeared in his livery, blue,
  with ragged staves on the sleeves; men who, after this nefarious act,
  were stigmatised with the title of 'The Black Jury who sold their
  country.' Sir Richard Bulkeley, who, with Sir William Herbert and others,
  superseded a prior commission, resisted this oppression with great
  firmness, and laid those odious grievances before the Queen, whose regard
  for her loyal subjects in Wales was evinced by the recalling of the first
  commission, by proclamation at Westminster, in 1579. The Earl being
  worsted, sought the life of Sir Richard by having him charged as above.
  But this generous and patriotic nobleman, by his excellent and manly
  conduct, overthrew every malevolent design of his enemy; and came out of
  this fiery trial as clear as the pellucid crystal of Snowdon."</p>

<h3>INMAN FAMILY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;198.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">A Subscriber</span> having challenged me by name to
  assist him in resolving his "historic doubts," I hasten to afford him
  what information I possess, conscious at the same time that I can add
  little or nothing that will materially aid him in his investigation.</p>

  <p>First, then, as to Owen Gam. This name savours strongly of the leek,
  both Christian and surname being unequivocally British. <i>Gam</i>, in
  Welsh, signifies the "one-eyed;" we may conclude, therefore, that this
  gentleman, or one of his progenitors, had lost an eye in one of the frays
  common in bygone days, and so acquired the appellation of <i>Gam</i>.
  <span class="sc">A Subscriber</span> has omitted to give dates with his
  Queries, and thus leaves us in the dark as to the precise period he
  refers to; still, it may interest him to know that David Gam, a landed
  proprietor of some importance in Herefordshire, temp. Henry IV. and V.,
  who had married the sister of Owen Glyndwr, was discovered in an attempt
  to assassinate his brother-in-law, the royal chieftain; and was, in
  consequence, arrested <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page354"></a>{354}</span>and confined ten years in Owen's prison at
  Llansaintffraid. He was afterwards released; and distinguished himself,
  together with some near relatives, as Pennant relates, at the battle of
  Agincourt, where he fell, pierced with wounds, while assisting in the
  rescue of his royal master King Henry. Possibly, Owen Gam may have been a
  descendant of this half-hero, half-assassin.</p>

  <p>Llewellyn Clifford, again, is a name strongly suggestive of its
  owner's connexion with Cambria. If <span class="sc">A Subscriber</span>
  has exhausted the resources of the Clifford pedigrees, it were, I
  suppose, useless to refer him to the ancestry of the defunct Earls of
  Cumberland; and especially to that part of it represented by Sir Roger de
  Clifford, of Clifford, co. Hereford, a famous soldier in the days of
  Henry III. and Edward I. He accompanied the latter monarch in his inroads
  into Wales, and fell in battle there, not far from Bangor, circa 1282-3,
  leaving several children; one of the younger of whom I conjecture to have
  been the father of the before-named Llewellyn Clifford. After having
  subjugated the country, we can easily fancy the conquerors perpetuating
  the event by naming certain of their posterity after the fallen prince
  Llewellyn.</p>

  <p>As for Sir William de Roas (or Ros), <span class="sc">A
  Subscriber</span> is wrong in supposing his name to have been Ingman; for
  although he resided at Ingmanthorpe, co. York, his surname, in common
  with that of a long line of ancestry and descendants, was De Ros only. He
  was the grandson of Robert de Ros, the founder of the two castles, Werke
  and Hamlake, and one of the leaders of the baronial forces in their armed
  opposition to the tyrant King John.</p>

  <p>Before closing this communication, I would suggest to <span
  class="sc">A Subscriber</span>, and to all others propounding
  genealogical Queries, the absolute necessity of affixing <i>dates</i> to
  their inquiries in every possible instance; as nothing is easier than to
  go astray, sometimes for half-a-dozen generations, in fixing the identity
  of a solitary individual.</p>

<h3>ROBERT DUDLEY, EARL OF LEICESTER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 105. 160.)</p>

  <p>That this infamous man <i>did</i> die of poison, is, I believe, the
  general opinion. The late Dr. Cooke Taylor has the following passage upon
  the subject, in his <i>Romantic Biography of the Age of Elizabeth</i>,
  vol. i. p.&nbsp;115.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nearly all the cotemporary writers assert that Leicester fell a
  victim to poison; Naunton declares that he, by mistake, swallowed the
  potion he had prepared for another person; and, as there can be no doubt
  that the Earl was a poisoner of great eminence and success, the story is
  far from being improbable. The Privy Council must have believed that his
  death was not natural, for they minutely investigated a report that he
  had been poisoned by the son of Sir James Crofts, in revenge for the
  imprisonment of his father. Some suspicious circumstances were elicited
  during the examination; but the matter was suddenly dropped, probably
  because an inquiry into any one of the complicated intrigues of
  Elizabeth's court would have involved too many persons of honour and
  consequence."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Drummond of Hawthornden, in his <i>Notes of Conversations with Ben
  Jonson</i>, has the following curious note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Earl of Leicester gave a bottle of liquor to his lady, which he
  willed her to use in any faintness; which she, after his returne from
  Court, not knowing it was poison, gave him, and so he died."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a strong confirmation of the statement given by Sir Robert
  Naunton.</p>

  <p>In one of the many valuable notes appended by Dr. Bliss to the
  <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, is the following cotemporary narrative, copied
  from a MS. memoranda on a copy of <i>Leicester's Ghost</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The author (of the poem) hath omitted the end of the Earle, the which
  may thus and truely be supplied. The Countesse Lettice fell in love with
  Christopher Blunt, gent., of the Earle's horse; and they had many secret
  meetings, and much wanton familiarity; the which being discovered by the
  Earle, to prevent the pursuit thereof, when Generall of the Low
  Countreys, hee tooke Blunt with him, and theire purposed to have him made
  away: and for this plot there was a ruffian of Burgundy suborned, who,
  watching him in one night going to his lodging at the Hage, followed him
  and struck at his head with a halbert or battle-axe, intending to cleave
  his head. But the axe glaunced, and withall pared off a great piece of
  Blunt's skull, which was very dangerous and longe in healinge: but he
  recovered, and after married the Countesse; who took this soe ill, as

  Earle, not patient of this soe greate wrong of his wife, purposed to
  carry her to Kenilworth; and to leave here there untill her death by

  manner, surfeiting with excessive eating and drinking, fell soe ill that
  he was forced to stay there. Then the deadly cordiall was propounded unto
  him by the Countesse; as Mr. William Haynes, sometimes the Earle's page,
  and then gentleman of his bed-chamber, told me, who protested hee saw her
  give that fatall cup to the Earle, which was his last draught, and an end
  of his plott against the Countesse, and of his journey, and of himselfe;

<h3>HARDMAN'S ACCOUNT OF WATERLOO.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;199.; Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;176.)</p>

  <p>I perfectly recollect reading, when a boy, a critique on this poem,
  and being much amused thereby. The critique appeared in the <i>Literary
  Gazette</i> or <i>Athenæum</i>, as well as I remember. I never saw the
  poem, but I recollect some of the lines quoted, which went nearly as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The following morning, at break of day,</p>
      <p>An orderly dragoon did come this way:</p>
      <p>'Holloa! holloa! I say, give ear,</p>
      <p>Is Adjutant Hardman quartered here?</p>
      <p>Holloa! halloa! I am not wrong,</p>
      <p>Is Adjutant Hardman here at home?'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I merely quote from memory and hope, therefore, that any deviations
  from the original may be pardoned.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant (Brevet Captain) Hardman, if not a first-rate poet, is a
  gallant soldier, and I rejoice to see his name in the <i>Army List</i>
  for March, 1854. I cannot ascertain at what period he joined the army,
  but he was present at the cavalry engagements of Sahagun and Benevente,
  on December 20th and 27th, 1808, on the retreat of Sir John Moore's army
  to Coruña, for which he is decorated with a Peninsula medal. For his
  bravery as a non-commissioned officer he was promoted, May 19, 1813, to a
  cornetcy in the royal wagon train; and was transferred, August 12
  following, to the 23rd Light Dragoons, and was same day appointed
  Regimental Adjutant of that corps. On the almost total change of officers
  that took place in the 10th Hussars, owing to the quarrels of Colonels
  Quentin and Palmer, Lieutenant Hardman succeeded Captain Bromley, on
  December 15, 1814, as Lieutenant and Adjutant in the corps in which he
  had commenced his military career; a sufficient proof of his having been
  a zealous, active, and efficient non-commissioned officer, when serving
  as such in the regiment. He embarked at Ramsgate with the service
  squadrons of his regiment in April, 1815, and landed at Ostend, whence
  the 10th regiment proceeded to Brussels: it was present at Quatre Bras,
  although not engaged with the enemy: and at Waterloo it behaved with the
  greatest gallantry, and lost two officers, nineteen soldiers, and
  fifty-one horses killed, in addition to six officers and twenty-six men
  wounded. Lieutenant Hardman's position as adjutant necessarily kept him
  in the vicinity of his commanding officers, Col. Quentin and Major
  Howard; therefore he was an eye-witness of poor Howard's death.
  Lieutenant Hardman received the Waterloo medal. The 10th Hussars landed
  at Ramsgate, from Boulogne, in January, 1816, and marched to Brighton,
  where Lieutenant Hardman resigned the adjutantcy, February 8, 1816, and
  exchanged to half-pay of the regiment, June 6, same year, since which
  period he has not served upon full pay.</p>

<h3>CHURCHES IN "DOMESDAY BOOK."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;151.)</p>

  <p>A. W. H. says, "In the case of many parishes it is stated [in
  <i>Domesday Book</i>], that there was a church there: is it considered
  <i>conclusive</i> authority that there was not one, if it is not
  mentioned in <i>Domesday Book</i>?" This question has, I doubt not, often
  engaged the attention of antiquaries; and I am somewhat surprised that
  the Query has elicited no reply. The conclusion has often been drawn
  that, no church being mentioned, none existed before the survey. It would
  appear this conclusion has been an erroneous one. In the last volume
  issued by the Chetham Society (<i>Documents relating to the Priory of
  Penwortham, and other Possessions in Lancashire of the Abbey of
  Evesham</i>, edited by W.&nbsp;A. Hulton, Esq.) that point is ably discussed;
  and as Mr. Hulton's views on a subject of so much interest cannot but be
  valuable, I venture to extract them, as worthy of a place in "N. &amp;
  Q." He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Donations of churches with tithes are made directly after the survey
  of <i>Domesday</i> was taken. And yet that survey is entirely silent as
  to their existence. Similar omissions have given rise to doubts, whether
  the institution of our parochial economy had been carried out to its full
  extent previous to the Conquest, and whether we are not indebted to the
  Normans for its full perfection. Such doubts are unfounded.... There is
  nothing in <i>Domesday</i> to justify the doubts alluded to. A
  consideration of the objects of that survey will dissipate them: the
  purpose was principally financial. It was directed so as to obtain a
  correct account of the taxable property within the kingdom. And it was
  immaterial whether the proceeds were paid altogether to the owner, or a
  definite portion was diverted into other channels. Therefore those
  churches which were endowed only with tithes of the surrounding
  districts, as Eccleston and Croston, Penwortham and Leyland, in Leyland
  Hundred, and Rochdale and Eccles, in Salford Hundred, were unnoticed,
  although the two first-named churches were granted by Roger de Poictou,
  with their tithes and other appurtenances, to the Priory of Lancaster;
  and the pages of the <i>Coucher Book of Whalley</i> prove the two latter
  churches to have existed at a date perhaps anterior to the Conquest. But
  the case was different when a church was endowed with glebe-land. Such a
  church appeared in the light of a landowner, and in that character is its
  existence notified. Thus, in modern Lancashire, south of the Ribble, the
  churches of Wigan and Winwick, Childwall, Walton, Warrington, Manchester,
  Blackburn, and Whalley are expressly named in <i>Domesday</i>, but
  invariably in connexion with the ownership of land. It seems clear,
  therefore, that the silence of <i>Domesday</i> cannot be urged as a proof
  of the <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>non-existence of a church, or of the
  subsequent grant of those rights and privileges by which its due
  efficiency is maintained."&mdash;<i>Introd.</i>, p.&nbsp;xxiii.</p>

<h3>MEMOIRS OF GRAMMONT.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 461. 549.; Vol. ix., pp. 3. 204.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ceste noble race de Grantmont."&mdash;<i>Brantôme.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following are some of the principal events in the life of the
  Chevalier de Grammont.</p>

  <p>He was born in the year 1621, probably at the family seat of Bidache,
  in Gascony.</p>

  <p>He was sent to the college at Pau in Béarn, the nearest university to
  the family residence. His studies here did not much benefit him; and
  although intended for the church, we find him at a later period actually
  highly commending the Lord's Prayer, and seriously inquiring by whom it
  was written. On his declining a clerical life, he was sent to the French
  army in Piedmont in 1643. He served under his brother, the Marshal, and
  the Prince de Condé; and was present at the three battles of Fribourg on
  the 3rd, 5th, and 9th Aug. 1644; and at that of Nordlinguen on the 3rd
  Aug. 1645. It was at the battle of Fribourg that the Prince de Condé,
  having failed in his first attack on the enemy, got off horseback, and
  placed himself at the head of the regiment of Conti, whilst all the
  officers and volunteers alighted also, amongst whom is mentioned the
  Chevalier de Grammont; and this reassuring the soldiers, they charged the
  enemy, who fled into a wood under favour of the approaching night. At
  Nordlinguen, the Marshal de Grammont was taken prisoner, and nearly
  murdered by the Germans, to revenge the death of their General, the great
  Mercy, who was slain in the battle. The Marshal was subsequently
  exchanged against Gen. Gleen.</p>

  <p>In 1647 Grammont served again under his brother and the Prince de
  Condé in Spain: and in 1648 he was present with them at the battle of
  Lens on the 20th Aug., where the Archduke Leopold and General Beck were
  totally defeated in Flanders.</p>

  <p>The troubles of the Fronde now commenced; and in the first instance
  Grammont zealously attached himself to the prince. In Dec. 1649, he
  tested the accuracy of the report that it was intended to assassinate the
  prince by sending his own coach with the prince's liveries over the Pont
  Neuf, to see what would occur. The result was, the coach was fired at;
  but, as no one was in it, the would-be assassins did no harm. During the
  imprisonment of the princes, Grammont, with others, joined the Spanish
  army which had advanced into Picardy, in consequence of the treaty the
  Duchesse de Longueville and Turenne had made with the King of Spain.</p>

  <p>We do not find when Grammont left the prince's party; the prince
  himself admitted it was with honour. He seems to have connected himself
  with Gaston, Duke of Orleans; and is styled about this time by "la Grande
  Mademoiselle" as one of her father's gentlemen. She also relates that
  when the royal forces threatened Orleans, the inhabitants sent to the
  duke for succour, and he sent the Count de Fiesque and Mons. de Grammont,
  who appeased their fears. The duke also advised his daughter to take the
  opinion of Fiesque and Grammont in all matters, as they had been in
  Orleans long enough to know what ought to be done. When Mademoiselle was
  trying to effect an entrance into the city, Grammont incited the
  inhabitants to assist in breaking open a gate, which the authorities,
  under fear of the royal displeasure, were afraid to direct. The gate was
  broken open, and she was borne in triumph along the streets.</p>

  <p>It was probably at this period that Grammont sighed for the Countess
  de Fiesque (about whom he, and his nephew the Count de Guiche,
  quarrelled); as Mademoiselle, in her <i>Memoirs</i>, relates that, in the
  year 1656, on her interview with Christina, Queen of Sweden, she
  presented to her, amongst others, the Countess de Fiesque, one of her
  ladies of honour. The Queen observed: "The Countess de Fiesque is not so
  beautiful as to have made so much noise; is the Chevalier de Grammont
  still in love with her?"</p>

  <p>In 1654 Grammont accompanied the Court to Peronne; where they
  anxiously awaited Turenne's attempt to force the Prince de Condé's lines
  at Arras, as related in the <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

  <p>On the 25th Nov. 1655, Madame de Sevigné writes to Bussi-Rabutin,
  relating an anecdote in which Grammont was a party.</p>

  <p>Madame de Motteville relates that Queen Christina rallied the
  Chevalier de Grammont on the passion he had then for the Duchesse de
  Merc&oelig;ur, one of Cardinal Mazarin's nieces; and spared him only on
  account of the utter hopelessness of it.</p>

  <p>It is about this period we are inclined to place Grammont's first
  visit to England; where curiosity, Hamilton informs us, drew him to see
  so remarkable a character as Cromwell; but this visit will be a good
  starting-place for the next Number.</p>

<h3>CELTIC AND LATIN LANGUAGES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 174. 280. 353.; Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;14.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Professor F. W. Newman, in his little work entitled <i>Regal
  Rome</i>, maintains that the old languages of Italy, especially the
  Umbrian and Sabine, contained a striking predominance of Celtic
  ingredients, and he wishes to show that this is still evident even in the
  Latin of Cicero. His proof rests on vocabularies (pp. 19&mdash;26.),
  especially in regard to the military, political, and <!-- Page 357
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>{357}</span>religious
  words which he supposes the Romans derived from the Sabines (p.&nbsp;61.).
  With regard to these lists, I have to observe, that while all that is
  valid in the comparison merely gives the Indo-Germanic of the Celtic
  languages&mdash;a fact beyond dispute&mdash;Mr. Newman takes no pains to
  discriminate between the marks of an original identity of root, and those
  words which the Celts of Britain derived from their Roman
  conquerors."&mdash;Donaldson's <i>Varronianus</i>, p.&nbsp;64.</p>

  <p>"It is to be remarked, that almost <i>all the words</i> of the British
  tongue agree either with the Greek or Latin. It is this strong similarity
  of features between their own language and those of Greece and Italy,
  that has induced so many of my countrymen to claim for it the honour of
  being the mother-tongue of all, and to scorn all examination which did
  not commence with this confession. Even the late learned Dr. Owen Pugh
  has, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, by arbitrarily selecting certain syllables
  as the roots of all Cumrian words, done much to foster this overweening
  conceit. The system was carried to its extreme point of absurdity by the
  Rev. Edward Davies, who by the help of such syllables expected to unravel
  the mysteries of all languages. This failure has I hope paved the way for
  the more sober consideration of the question, which, if worked out
  fairly, will in my opinion establish the claim of the Cumrian tongue, if
  not to be the mother of all tongues, at least to be a valuable branch of
  the Caucasian tree of languages. Now, had the two races, the Roman and
  Cumrian, remained always separate, a comparative etymology would have
  been an easy task; for no more would be necessary than to put the similar
  roots, having the same meaning, side by side. But, unfortunately for the
  scholar who undertakes to prove the question, the Romans were in this
  island four hundred years, colonised it partly, and partly gave it their
  own form of civilisation. As before mentioned, the inhabitants adopted
  with avidity the Roman dress, language, and literature. That language
  must therefore be supposed to have entered deeply into the composition of
  the present Cumrian tongue. The sceptical examiner may therefore
  reasonably object, that any similarity between the two languages might
  have originated in the adoption of that of Rome by the British
  provincials. In answer to this I refer in the first place to Lloyd's
  reasoning, quoted in the note," viz. that the same similarity exists
  between the Latin and the Erse [see Newman, in the <i>Classical
  Museum</i>, vol. vi.]. "In the second place to the fact, that Wales and
  Cornwall do not appear to have been occupied, like the rest of England,
  by the Romans."... "Still, however, the long residence of the Romans in
  the island, with the known influence always produced by such a state of
  things, renders every statement grounded on the similarity alone of the
  languages of the two races, the conquered and the conquerors, liable to
  suspicion. I have therefore been compelled to enter upon an exceedingly
  difficult investigation, which, if successful, must prove the radical
  identity of the Latin and Cumrian tongues. The proof is this: If there
  are derivative words in the Latin, of which we must seek the primitives
  in the Cumrian, and if these primitives be shown to furnish an
  explanation of many words before inexplicable on etymological principles.
  For example, if the word 'to tread' under various forms be found, with
  the meaning 'to trample with the feet,' in most of the western languages
  of Europe, and have no noun to base itself upon in these languages, and
  yet the noun 'traed the feet' be found in one of them, the inference is
  irresistible that the verb in all its forms was derived from this root.
  To deny this would be equivalent to a denial that the Latin verb
  <i>calcare</i> came from <i>calx</i>, 'the heel.' In the following list,
  such words alone, with a few exceptions for the sake of etymological
  illustration, have been introduced. It might have been indefinitely
  extended, but the difficulty was to confine the examples within moderate
  limits."&mdash;Williams on <i>One Source of the Non-Hellenic Portion of
  the Latin Language</i>.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This eminent scholar supplies sixty-two, with explanatory notes, and
  subjoins a list of sixty-three. Under the example "Occo, occare, <i>to
  harrow</i>," he observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Persons who wish to draw subtle inferences say that all the terms of
  the Romans connected with agriculture may be referred to a Greek source,
  while the terms expressive of war and hunting are non-Hellenic. The
  induction fails completely in both parts, as might easily be shown. When
  Cæsar landed in Britain, the natives were agriculturists, densely
  planted. And Halley proved, that the harvest which Cæsar's soldiers
  reaped had ripened at the average period of a Kentish harvest in his
  days. Assuredly then the Britons had not the agricultural names to learn
  from the Romans of an after age."</p>

  <p>"I begin," says Newman, "with the country and domestic animals, which
  will show how very far from the truth Niebuhr was, when he imagined that
  in words connected with 'the gentler pursuits of life' the Roman language
  has peculiarly extensive agreement with the Hellenic."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When your correspondent T. H. T. says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Professor Newman, in his <i>Regal Rome</i>, has drawn attention to
  the subject; but his induction does not appear sufficiently extensive to
  warrant any decisive conclusion respecting the position the Celtic holds
  as an element of the Latin,"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>he could not have known that the same writer has, in the sixth volume
  of the <i>Classical Museum</i>, continued the comparison at great length;
  and as that work falls into the hands of but few, I shall transcribe some
  passages which may throw light on the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It has for some years been recognised, at least by several English
  scholars, that there is a remarkable similarity between the Celtic
  languages and Latin. In the case of Welsh it was, I believe, at first
  supposed that the words must have been introduced by the Roman dominion
  in Britain; but when the likeness was found to exist in the Erse, and
  that the Erse was even more like to Latin (as regards the consonants)
  than the Welsh is, this idea of course fell to <!-- Page 358 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>{358}</span>the ground. The scholar
  and physiologist, who pressed into notice the strong similarities of the
  Celtic to the European languages, and claimed a place for Celtic within
  that group, Dr. Prichard, has naturally fixed his attention with so much
  strength on the <i>primitive</i> relations of all these tongues, as to be
  jealous and suspicious of an argument, which alleges that the one has
  borrowed from the other. Some ten years ago, by his favour, I read a MS.
  of a vocabulary (the composition of Dr. Stratton, formerly of Aberdeen),
  which compared the Gaelic with the Latin tongue in alphabetical order
  without comment or development. From this vocabulary Prichard gives an
  extract in his chapter on the Italian nations, and finds it entirely to
  confirm his views that the Roman language has not suffered any larger
  admixture by a foreign action. What is or was Dr. Stratton's opinion, I
  never heard. His vocabulary first suggested to me the value of this
  inquiry, and that is all. Having now been led to a fuller examination of
  the Welsh and Gaelic dictionaries, I find not only a far greater
  abundance of material (especially in the Welsh) than I could have
  imagined; but also, that by grouping words aright, conclusions result
  such as I had not expected, and adverse to those of Dr. Prichard."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Professor Newman, as T. H. T. has observed, confined himself to a
  tabular view of Celtic and Latin words; but the grammatical structure and
  formal development of the two languages have not been overlooked in the
  philological literature of England. These interesting inquiries have been
  pursued by Dr. Prichard, in his elaborate treatise on the <i>Eastern
  Origin of the Celtic Nations</i>, and the Rev. W.&nbsp;D. Conybeare, (in his
  <i>Theological Lectures delivered in Bristol College in 1831-33</i>) has
  shown that it is by thus analysing the grammatical structure, which forms
  the very skeleton of languages, rather than by confining our attention to
  mere vocabularies, that we may best detect their true affinities, and has
  illustrated this doctrine by a few Welsh examples. In the <i>West of
  England Archæological Journal</i> is exhibited (I believe by the same
  author) the identity of verbal forms in the Welsh and Latin
  languages.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Archdeacon Williams maintains that two languages may
  have a common vocabulary, but different grammars<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Latin language, whether from Pelasgic or Achæan influence,
  adopted at an early period the Hellenic grammar; and, under the skilful
  hands of the bilingual Ennius, became that polished interpreter of
  thought, which yields in regularity and majesty to the Greek alone. The
  Cumri either retained, which is more probable, a still more ancient, or
  invented a grammar, now peculiar to themselves. This, although it be
  simple and scientific in the highest degree, is so completely at variance
  with all the other grammars of the civilised world, that scholars who
  have to acquire it late in life feel the strongest repugnance to its
  forms and principles, and are tempted to regard a language more fixed and
  unchangeable in its principles than any other existing, as more slippery
  and grasp-escaping than the Proteus of the Grecian mythology."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Since I wrote these extracts, I have been much gratified by the
  perusal of Archdeacon Williams's <i>Gomer</i>, which I recommend to all
  interested in this inquiry.</p>

  <p>I am led to propose this subject for the consideration of practical
  photographists, and, if possible, that amateurs may arrive at something

  wasteful, and expensive without cause. I trust you agree with me in
  thinking that it would be of use to a large number of beginners to have
  the proportions best suited for printing positives defined as near as
  possible, and not be left to guess at proportions varying from ½ grain to
  60 grains, and from 20 to 120. I have written hurriedly, and hope you

  the brothers MM. Bisson, have succeeded in obtaining, by means of this
  wonderful art, copies of a fidelity attainable by no other process: so
  that the wondrous lights, shades, half-tones, and chiaro-obscuro, for
  which Rembrandt is so remarkable, are preserved in all their original
  beauty. The plates will be accompanied by descriptive letter-press, and
  by a Biography of Rembrandt from the pen of M. Charles Blanc. As the
  works are so numerous, the first series will consist of forty plates, to
  be issued in ten livraisons, each containing four plates, price twenty
  francs; a very moderate sum, if we remember that among the works thus to
  be issued, at a cost of five francs each, will be found copies of such
  gems as the <i>Avocat Tolling</i> and the <i>Pièce de Cent
  Florins</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Coloured Photographs.</i>&mdash;I have lately seen, and very much
  admired, some specimens of photographic coloured portraits. They have all
  the broad effect of the great masters perfectly in detail, and none of
  the niggling effect of many coloured photographs, which are in fact
  specimens of miniature painting rather than photography&mdash;the outline
  alone being given by the photographic art. The specimens I refer to
  appear to have been soaked in oil, or some transparent varnish, and then
  coloured in separate tints, probably from the back; the shadows being
  <i>entirely</i> photographic. It is evident they are quickly and easily
  executed; but I am desirous of knowing the exact process, and shall be
  much obliged for information on the subject.</p>

  <p><i>Christian Names</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 406. 488. 626.).&mdash;The
  earliest instance I have yet met with, of an individual with two
  Christian names, occurs in the compulsory cession of the Abbey of Vale
  Royal to King Henry VIII.; the deed conveying which is still extant in
  the Augmentation Office. It is in Latin, and signed by John Harwood the
  Abbot, Alexander Sedon the Prior, <i>William Brenck Harrysun</i>, and
  twelve other monks of the Abbey. Vale Royal Abbey is now the seat of Lord
  Delamere, into whose family it came by purchase in 1616, from the
  descendant of Sir Thomas Holcroft, the original grantee from the
  crown.</p>

  <p><i>Abigail</i> (Vol. iv., pp. 424., &amp;c.; Vol. viii.,
  p.&nbsp;653.).&mdash;Your recent correspondents on this subject do not appear
  to have met with the passage in which I mentioned, that since putting the
  question, I had found that a waiting-maid in Beaumont and Fletcher's
  comedy of <i>The Scornful Lady</i> was named Abigail; and that, as the
  play appeared to have been a favourite one, the application of the name
  to the class generally was probably owing to it. In the absence of any
  proof of its having been previously used in this sense, I still continue
  to think that this conjecture was well founded. Considering the terms on
  which Dean Swift was with the Mashams, he was the last person in the
  world to have used such a term, unless it had been so long in familiar
  use as to be deprived of all appearance of personal allusion to them.</p>

  <p>"<i>Begging the question</i>" (Vol. viii., p.&nbsp;640.).&mdash;This phrase

  <p><i>Russian Emperors</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;222.).&mdash;I am informed by a

  however, that after a twenty-five years' reign the monarch has even more
  absolute and despotic authority than before the lapse of that time. I
  hope this subject may be well ventilated, as considerable misapprehension
  exists about it.</p>

  <p><i>Garble</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;243.).&mdash;Your correspondent E. S. T.
  T. was mistaken when he said that the "corrupt" meaning of the word
  <i>garble</i> is now the only one ever used. In proof of this I would
  give one instance, familiar to me, in which it still retains its "good"
  signification. In "working" cochineal, spices, and other similar
  merchandise at the warehouse in which they are stored upon their arrival
  in this country, the operation of <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>sifting and separating
  the good from the bad is termed <i>garbling</i>: the word being here
  employed in the very same sense as in the examples quoted by E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;T.,
  illustrative of its original meaning, and which sense he erroneously
  stated it no longer possessed.</p>

  <p class="author">R. V. T.</p>

  <p class="address">Mincing Lane.</p>

  <p>I cannot agree with your correspondent E. S. T. T., that a corruption
  of meaning has taken place in this word; and that whereas it originally
  meant a selection of the good and a discarding of the bad parts of
  anything, its present meaning, is exactly the reverse of this. Its
  original signification is correctly stated: the garbling of spices,
  drugs, &amp;c., meant the selection of the good and the rejection of the
  bad. But the garbling of a passage cited as a testimony is a precisely
  analogous process. The person who garbles the passage omits those parts
  which can be used against his view, and adduces only those parts which
  support his conclusion. He selects the parts which are good, and rejects
  those which are bad, <i>for his purpose</i>. When a passage is said to be
  garbled, it is always implied that the person who quotes it has
  suppressed a portion which tells against himself; but that portion is, so
  far as he is concerned, the <i>bad</i>, not the <i>good</i> portion. The
  secondary and metaphorical is therefore precisely analogous to the
  primary and literal sense of the word, and not the reverse of it.</p>

  <p><i>Electric Telegraph</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;270.).&mdash;As every new
  attempt to improve this invaluable invention, and to extend its use, is
  of world-wide importance, the following extract from <i>La Presse</i>, a
  French newspaper of March 23rd, will excite inquiry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On écrit de Berne, le 17 Mars, MM. Brunner et Hipp, directeurs des

  télégraphiques, on peut transmettre une dépêche. L'essai de cet appareil
  a été fait à deux lieues de Berne, dans un lieu où il n'existe aucune

  <p><i>Butler's "Lives of the Saints"</i> (Vol. viii., p.387.).&mdash;The
  inquiry respecting the various editions of this valuable work not having
  yet received any answer, the following information may in some degree
  satisfy the inquirer. The first edition of the Rev. Alban Butler's
  <i>Lives of the Saints</i> was published in the author's lifetime, at
  various intervals from 1754 to 1759, when the last of the four volumes
  appeared, of which the edition was composed. Part II. of vol. iii. is now
  before me, with the date 1758. No other edition appeared till after the
  death of the learned and pious author, which took place in 1773.</p>

  <p>The second edition was undertaken by the most Rev. Dr. Carpenter,
  Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, and appeared in 12 vols. in 1779. It
  is stated in the title-page to be "corrected and enlarged from the
  author's own MS." It did contain all the notes omitted in the previous
  edition, and other matter prepared by the author. The third edition was
  published in Scotland, and other editions followed; but I am unable to
  give any particulars of them. But the splendid stereotype edition,
  published in London by Murphy, in 1812, in 12 vols., is by far the best
  ever produced, or ever likely to appear. Since this there have been other
  editions; one in 2 vols., published in Ireland, and a cheap edition in 12
  small vols., printed at Derby; but they deserve little notice.</p>

  <p><i>Anticipatory Use of the Cross</i> (Vol. viii.
  <i>passim</i>).&mdash;In answer to particular inquiry, I have been
  furnished by a resident in Macao with an answer, of which the following
  is the substance:&mdash;The cross is commonly used in China, and consists
  of any flat boards of sufficient size, the upright shaft being usually
  eight to ten feet high. The transverse bar is fixed by a single nail or
  rivet, and is therefore often loose, and may be made sometimes to
  traverse a complete circle. It is not so much an instrument of punishment
  in itself, as it is an operation-board whereon to confine the criminal,
  not with nails, but ropes, to undergo&mdash;as in the case of a woman
  taken in adultery&mdash;the cutting away of the flesh from the bosom. He
  adds, that he has witnessed such punishment, and he has no doubt that the
  cross has been used in this way in China immemorially. Any of your
  correspondents will much oblige me by correcting or confirming this
  statement from positive testimony.</p>

  <p><i>The Marquis of Granby</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;127.).&mdash;A portrait of
  this nobleman constitutes the sign of a public-house at Doncaster, and of
  another at Bawtry, nine miles from that town. His lordship, it is said,
  occasionally occupied Carr House, near the former place, as a hunting-box
  in the middle of the last century. As an instance of his lordship's
  popularity, I may here add, that out of compliment to him, and for his
  greater convenience in hunting, at a period when there was a considerable
  extent of uninclosed and undrained country around Doncaster, the
  corporation directed several banks and passages to be made on their
  estate at Rossington; and in 1752, that body likewise presented the
  Marquis with the freedom of the borough.</p>

  <p><i>Rev. John Cawley</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;247.).&mdash;In reply to the

  the following extract from Wood's <i>Athenæ</i> (Bliss's edition), vol.
  iv. col. 580.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"John Cawley, son of Will. Cawley of the city of Chichester, gent.,
  was, by the endeavours of his father, made Fellow of All Souls' College
  (from that of Magdalen) by the visitors appointed by Parliament, anno
  1649; took the degrees in arts, that of Master being completed in 1654;
  and whether he became a preacher soon after, without any orders conferred
  on him by a bishop, I cannot tell. Sure I am, that after his Majesty's
  restoration, he became a great loyalist, disowned the former actions of
  his father, who had been one of the judges of King Charles I.; when he
  was tryed for his life by a pretended court of justice, rayled at him
  (being then living in a skulking condition beyond sea); and took all
  opportunities to free himself from having any hand or anything to do in
  the times of usurpation. About which time, having married one of the
  daughters of Mr. Pollard of Newnham Courtney, he became rector of Dedcot,
  or Dudcot, in Berkshire; rector of Henley in Oxfordshire; and in the
  beginning of March, 1666, Archdeacon of Lincoln."</p>

  <p><i>New Zealander and Westminster Bridge</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 74.
  159.).&mdash;Your correspondents have traced this celebrated passage to a
  letter from Horace Walpole to Sir H. Mann, and to passages in poems by
  Mrs. Barbauld and Kirke White. It appears to me that the following
  extract from the Preface to P.&nbsp;B. Shelley's <i>Peter Bell the Third</i>,
  has more resemblance to it. It is addressed to Moore:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hoping that the immortality which you have given to the Fudges you
  will receive from them; and in the firm expectation, that when London
  shall be an habitation of bitterns, when St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey
  shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins, in the midst of an unpeopled
  marsh; when the piers of Westminster Bridge shall become the nuclei of
  islets of reeds and osiers, and cast the jagged shadows of their broken
  arches on the solitary stream; some transatlantic commentator will be
  weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined <span

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John Thrupp.</span></p>

  <p class="address">10. York Gate.</p>

  <p>Several passages from different writers having been mentioned in your
  columns as likely to have suggested to our brilliant essayist and
  historian his celebrated graphic sketch of the New Zealander meditating
  over the ruins of London, I would beg leave to hint the probability that
  not one of those many passages were present to his mind or memory at the
  moment he wrote. The fact is that the picture is so true to nature, and
  has been so often sketched, and the associations and reflections arising
  from it so often felt and described, that I cannot for a moment admit the
  insinuation of a charge of plagiarism, or even unconscious adaptation of
  another's thoughts in one so abundantly stored with imagery of his own,
  that the very overflowings of his own wealth would enrich a generation of
  writers. It has however occurred to me that his classic mind might have
  remembered the picture of Marius amid the ruins of Carthage, or, more
  probably, the still more striking passage in the celebrated letter of
  Sulpicius to Cicero, on the death of his daughter Tullia, in which he
  describes himself, on his return from Asia, as sailing from Ægina towards
  Megara, and contemplating the surrounding countries:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Behind me lay Ægina, before me Megara; on my right I saw Piræus, and
  on my left Corinth. These cities, once so flourishing and magnificent,
  now presented nothing to my view but a sad spectacle of desolation."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And he then proceeds with his melancholy reflections on so many
  perishing memorials of human glory and grandeur in so small a
  compass.</p>

  <p>Volney wrote thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Qui sait si sur les rives de la Seine, de la Tamise ... dans le
  tourbillon de tant de jouissances ... un voyageur, comme moi, ne
  s'asseoira pas un jour sur de muettes ruines, et ne pleurera pas

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Mackenzie Walcott, M.A.</span></p>

  <p><i>Misapplication of Terms</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;44.).&mdash;I cannot
  pretend to set up my judgment against that of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Squeers</span>, who has in his favour the proverbial wisdom of the
  Schools. Riddle, however, who I believe is an authority, gives the word
  <span class="sc">Lego</span> no such meaning as "to hearken." If Plautus
  uses the word in that sense, as it is an uncommon one, the passage should
  have been quoted, or a reference given. The meaning of <!-- Page 362
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>{362}</span>the word
  appears to be "to collect, run over, see, read, choose." In justification
  of my criticism, and in reply to <span class="sc">Mr. Squeers</span>, I
  shall quote Horne Tooke's remark, in speaking of "<span title="ta deonta" class="grk"
  >&tau;&alpha; &delta;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;</span>, or things
  which ought to be done;" <i>Div. Purley</i>, Pt. II. ch. viii. (vol. ii.
  pp. 499-501., edit. 1849):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The first of these, <span class="sc">Legend</span>, which means
  <i>That which ought to be read</i>, is, from the early misapplication of
  the term by impostors, now used by us as if it meant, <i>That which ought
  to be laughed at</i>. And so it is explained in our Dictionaries."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the hazard of being again deemed hypercritical, while on this
  subject, <i>the misapplication of terms</i>, I must question the
  correctness of the phrase "<i>Under</i> the <i>circum</i>stance." A thing
  must be <i>in</i> or <i>amidst</i> its <i>circum</i>-stances; it cannot
  be <i>under</i> them. I admit the commonness of the expression, but it is
  not the less a solecism. Can you inform me when it was introduced? I hope
  it is not old enough to be considered inveterate. The best authors write
  "in the circumstances;" and yet so prevalent is the anomaly, that in a
  very respectable periodical, not long since, the French "<i>dans</i> les
  circonstances présentes," given as a quotation, is rendered "<i>Under</i>
  the present circumstances."</p>
